<!--CSS Daily Challenge

Create a table of 4 of your favorite movies. The table should contain two rows. The first row should contain the title of the movie and the second row should contain a photo of the movie, and brief description of the movie's plot. Using what you learned about nesting in Sass, style the table and all of it's data. The title of the movie should link to a site where someone can purchase the movie if they would like.
